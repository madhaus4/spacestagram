### Summary
Modeled after instagram's user friendly layout, this application has a responsive design that can be used from mobile to desktop devices.

When the user first lands on the page, they are greeted by 40 random NASA images.  There is a 'view favorites' button in the navigation bar where the user can view all of their favorited posts.  On either page, you can just scroll through the posts; each has a title, date, image and description of the image.  While on the home screen, the page can be refreshed to get another set of randomized images.
